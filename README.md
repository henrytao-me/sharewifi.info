# Coding convention

### `id` in `layout`

- Use `underscore` style. Ex: `@+id/md_toolbar`

- All the view which will be injected into `Activity` / `Fragment` / `Adapter` should have a prefix. It's recommended to use `view` as a standard prefix. Ex: `mViewUser`, `mViewPassword`, `mButtonReset`, `mButtonOK`
